[ Version 1.4 - Christmas 2022  ]

Hello player! Hope you have a good day, after long wait I present to you, Platblue Beats Christmas Update!
This is first part of this update, because I don't have much time, next update should be out in next couple of days.
But now, let's see what new in this update;

[NEW GAMEMODE/STYLE: Rhythm Style]
Tired of dodging things? Now you can hit things!
This new style is very similar to things like DDR and osu!mania
So if you like these games, this style is for you!
Currently this gamemode has only two official songs: Lagomorpha by Niko and MAXRAGE by EBIMAYO, more will be added later!

[1 New Song]
- MAXRAGE by EBIMAYO
yep only one new song, for now...

[New fresh animations and UI changes]
- This update completly remakes the settings menu, it's now much more nicer and has a lot more options!
- "AZAPRU" logo now has short animation at start
- Remade Platblue Beats into animation

[CRT Shader]
Now the game looks way more cool with CRT shader! If you want to disable it, you can find options for that in settings menu.

[Quick Song Selection Menu]
Tired of nonstop press arrow keys to just find a song you are looking for? Well now we have a quick song selection menu!
It displays all of the songs in a grid, just hover your mouse over them to listen to them!

[Other Changes]
- Game can now be paused with Enter key
- Removed tools
- Mods and Custom Songs are now stored in "%appdata%\.platbluebeats" folder instead of sitting in a game files, updating should be much easier now!
- New custom mouse pointer
- You can preview song duration now
- Songs will now show how much minutes/seconds are left.
- A lot of new settings
- Added ability to disable constant image reloading, turning this off will cause mods that modify images to break.

also... Merry Christmas!
