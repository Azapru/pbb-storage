Hi everyone, I have some bad and good news...
Platblue Beats will no longer be supported by me and its now cancelled.
The launcher will continue to work until December 31st  2023, after that the game will no longer be playable through launcher.
But, I will remake this game in the future, so don't worry...
But first I need to finish other projects....

So thanks ya'all for playing (even that almost no one played this)

and of course.... 
Don't forget to check out Platblue Beats Community page! You can go there by clicking "Community" button in the main menu.
(even that its dead)
