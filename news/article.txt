[ The future of Platblue Beats ]
So... my plan for future updates is to add things like new modes, more songs and a lot more.
I might take a small break from updating this game and come back with big Halloween update...

Also, yes, there will be 2.0.0 update, I don't know when exactly but it will be, for 2.0 I am planning to add story mode!
More info about story mode soon...
