Duo to corruption of the whole project on my pc,
I'm officially cancelling Platblue Beats project.
I'm so dumb for not doing correct backups and not open-sourcing the project.
(I ACTUALLY WAS GOING TO OPEN-SOURCE IT IN THE NEXT UPDATE:sob::sob:)

The game will still be availaible to download (with Spooky Season Update).

While this is the end for Platblue Beats, this is NOT the end for Platblue Series!
More very cool and fun games are in progress, so make sure to follow Azapru on social medias
to don't miss new games!

R.I.P. Platblue Beats, 2022 Q2 - 2022 Q4
